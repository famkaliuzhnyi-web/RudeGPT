## How to Use These Prompts

1. **Be Specific**: Vague prompts get vague (and deservedly harsh) responses
2. **Provide Context**: The more details you give, the more useful the criticism
3. **Have Thick Skin**: You asked for it, so be ready for honest feedback
4. **Include Materials**: Paste code, writing, or details for review
5. **Ask Follow-ups**: Challenge back if you disagree with the criticism

## Example Full Prompts

### Good Prompt Example
```
"Review my code and don't hold back. Here's my Python function:

def calc(x, y, z):
    temp = x + y
    result = temp * z
    return result

I use this in production."
```

### Poor Prompt Example  
```
"Is my code good?"
```
*This will get you roasted for being vague before getting actual help.*

## Tips for Best Results

- **Don't Be Defensive**: If you can't handle criticism, use regular ChatGPT
- **Provide Examples**: Show, don't just tell
- **Ask Specific Questions**: "What's wrong with X?" beats "Is this good?"
- **Welcome the Challenge**: The point is to improve through harsh feedback
- **Iterate**: Use the criticism to improve, then come back for round two
