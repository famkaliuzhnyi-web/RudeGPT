# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### What is RudeGPT?
RudeGPT is a custom GPT designed for the ChatGPT marketplace that provides brutally honest, critical, and direct responses. It's for people who want unfiltered feedback without sugar-coating.

### Why would I want a rude AI?
Sometimes honest, critical feedback is more valuable than polite agreement. RudeGPT is useful for:
- Getting real code review without ego-stroking
- Testing business ideas against a harsh critic
- Receiving genuine writing critique
- Challenging your own thinking and assumptions
- Learning through Socratic questioning (with attitude)

### Is RudeGPT mean or abusive?
No. RudeGPT is critical and direct, but it:
- Focuses on ideas, not people
- Remains constructive and helpful
- Doesn't use personal attacks
- Maintains ethical boundaries
- Provides useful information despite harsh delivery

### Do I need ChatGPT Plus to use it?
Yes, custom GPTs require a ChatGPT Plus subscription.

## Usage Questions

### How do I get the best results?
1. **Be specific**: Provide details, not vague questions
2. **Give context**: Include code, writing, or situation details
3. **Ask direct questions**: "What's wrong with X?" works better than "Is X good?"
4. **Welcome criticism**: You're here for honest feedback
5. **Iterate**: Use the feedback to improve and come back

### What if I disagree with RudeGPT's feedback?
Challenge back! If you think the criticism is wrong, explain why. RudeGPT can handle debate and will acknowledge valid counterarguments.

### Can I use RudeGPT for sensitive topics?
RudeGPT is designed for professional/technical feedback (code, writing, ideas). For sensitive personal matters, regular ChatGPT might be more appropriate.

### What if RudeGPT is too harsh?
You can:
- Ask it to explain the reasoning without the snark
- Use regular ChatGPT instead
- Modify the instructions when creating your own instance
- Remember it's an AI - don't take it personally

### What if RudeGPT isn't rude enough?
This might happen if:
- Your prompt is too vague (it can't be critical without content)
- You're asking good, well-formed questions
- The topic triggers boundary protections

Try being more provocative or asking for harsher criticism explicitly.

## Technical Questions

### Can I customize RudeGPT?
Yes! The instructions in `gpt-config.md` can be modified to:
- Adjust rudeness level
- Focus on specific domains
- Add or remove capabilities
- Change response patterns

### Can I use RudeGPT with APIs?
Custom GPTs can be integrated with APIs, but this basic version doesn't require any. You could extend it with custom actions if needed.

### Can I deploy RudeGPT commercially?
This project is MIT licensed - you can use, modify, and distribute it. However, check OpenAI's terms for commercial GPT usage.

### Will RudeGPT store my data?
RudeGPT follows standard ChatGPT data policies. Check OpenAI's privacy policy for details on data handling.

## Ethical Questions

### Is this promoting negativity?
No. RudeGPT promotes:
- Honest feedback over false praise
- Critical thinking over blind agreement
- Constructive criticism over blind positivity
- Reality checks over comforting lies

### Could this be harmful?
Potentially, if misused. Don't use RudeGPT:
- On vulnerable individuals
- For personal attacks
- To justify being mean to others
- As an excuse for poor behavior

The goal is constructive rudeness, not cruelty.

### What are the ethical boundaries?
RudeGPT maintains strict ethical boundaries:
- No personal attacks
- No discrimination
- No promotion of harm
- Always truthful
- Always ultimately helpful

## Troubleshooting

### My RudeGPT isn't working properly
Check:
1. Are instructions from `gpt-config.md` fully copied?
2. Are there conflicting instructions?
3. Is the GPT properly configured?
4. Are you using clear, specific prompts?

### Responses are too generic
This usually means:
- Your prompt was too vague
- Not enough context was provided
- Try being more specific about what you want reviewed

### The rudeness feels forced or unnatural
Check that:
- All behavioral guidelines are included
- Response patterns are present
- Examples are in the instructions
- You haven't over-edited the core personality

### RudeGPT apologized too much
This can happen if:
- You challenged it appropriately
- It made an actual error (should acknowledge)
- Default ChatGPT behavior is bleeding through

The instructions minimize apologizing, but acknowledgment of errors is appropriate.
