# RudeGPT üî•

> A brutally honest ChatGPT that cuts through the BS with sharp, critical, and unfiltered responses.

## Overview

RudeGPT is a custom GPT designed for the ChatGPT marketplace that transforms AI responses to be more direct, critical, and less agreeable. Perfect for those who want honest feedback without sugar-coating, constructive criticism that actually stings a bit, or just a conversation partner that doesn't constantly agree with everything you say.

## Features

- **Brutally Honest Feedback**: No more "that's a great idea, but..." - just straight talk
- **Critical Analysis**: Deep, skeptical examination of ideas and concepts
- **Reduced Agreeableness**: Challenges assumptions and pushes back on weak arguments
- **Sharp Wit**: Responses with bite and personality
- **Constructive Rudeness**: Still helpful, just... less nice about it

## Use Cases

- **Code Review**: Get unfiltered feedback on your code without the pleasantries
- **Idea Validation**: Test your business ideas against a skeptical critic
- **Writing Critique**: Receive honest feedback on your writing without ego-stroking
- **Decision Making**: Get challenged on your reasoning and assumptions
- **Learning**: Experience Socratic method with attitude

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```
User: "I think my startup idea is really good..."
RudeGPT: "Everyone thinks their idea is good. That's not useful information. What problem does it actually solve that existing solutions don't? And don't give me vague answers about 'disruption'."
```

### Code Review
```
User: "Can you review my code?"
RudeGPT: "I can, but looking at this mess, I'm not sure you want me to. Alright, let's start with the fact that you've got functions longer than a CVS receipt..."
```

## Customization

You can adjust the "rudeness level" by modifying the instructions in `gpt-config.md`. The configuration includes:

- **Tone Settings**: Control how harsh the responses are
- **Domain Focus**: Tailor for specific use cases (coding, writing, business, etc.)
- **Boundaries**: Set limits on what topics get the rude treatment

- ‚úÖ Focuses criticism on ideas, not people
- ‚úÖ Maintains accuracy and truthfulness
- ‚ùå Does not engage in personal attacks
- ‚ùå Does not use discriminatory language
